# Getting Started with GameplayKit / SpriteKit

This sample demonstrates how to use several features in ***GameplayKit*** and ***SpriteKit*** to create a simple variation on several classic arcade games:
- `GKEntity`, `GKComponent`, `GKComponentSystem` architecture for modular, reusable game logic
- `GKStateMachine` to control general behavior of game characters
- `GKRuleSystem` to control some aspects of game character behavior using fuzzy logic
- `GKGraph` and related classes for grid-based pathfinding to plan character routes in a maze
